The functional calculator.

If the input is a number, we record it and show it on the display.
If the two consecutive inputs are all numbers, we know the latter one is another digit.

If the input is an operator, we calculate based on previous value and current value.
If the two consecutive inputs are all operators, we hold the calculation but update the previous saved operator, until we receive another input number.

If euqal sign is clicked, it will do the calculation and initialize the calculator.
If user tries to divide by 0, it will show error information and initialize the calculator.
